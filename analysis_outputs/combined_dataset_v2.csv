,,Deutsche Bank,"Rod:
Here are their credit issues:

1. In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically 
says that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting 
determines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its 
obligations under the Master is ""endangered"", then no cross default is 
triggered.

2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the 
""materially weaker"" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated 
below BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have 
language that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee 
provides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to 
such party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not 
want to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?

3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below 
BBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold 
language.

4. They are saying that for ""operational"" purposes, they cannot agree to 
""netting"".

5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities 
with a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.

6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of 
Exposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with 
a party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally 
the following procedures apply:

a. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute 
by the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral 
request was made.

b. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request

c. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the ""Resolution Time"" and if 
a resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and 
market quotations have to be obtained.

We normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute 
notice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the 
dispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the 
dispute on their own.  What do you think?

7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned 
is transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to 
last.

Let me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could 
resolve with your counterpart at DB.

,,Re: Enron Monterrey/Vitro,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

,,Installation Inquiry for New Software,"Dear Phillip,

I'm currently facing a conundrum with my laptop and require your expertise. Specifically, I'm unsure of how to proceed with installing new programs in the absence of administrator's privileges.

For instance, my travels often necessitate utilization of AOL to access my emails and maintain communication with our office. However, the constraints of my present operating system, Windows 2000, is hindering this process and I'm unable to proceed with the installation.

Further amplifying the issue, I have a piece of private statistical software that is critical for late-night work during business trips. Regrettably, installing it has also become a challenge due to the same administrative roadblock.

Your prompt attention and advice on how to navigate around this issue would be immensely valuable.

,,J Aron,"Tanya:
Here is the issue with respect to the Goldman Guaranty.  The new Guarantor is 
now The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (previously it was The Goldman Sachs Group, 
LP).  In the existing Guaranty, we permitted Goldman to assign its rights to 
a Successor Guarantor without our consent if the Successor Guarantor met the 
following qualifications:

1. (a)  if the Successor Guarantor is a corporation, at least 50% of the 
voting stock had to be held by the same entities/persons that owned and 
controlled the previous Guarantor

 (b)  if the Successor Guarantor is a partnership, it had to be controlled by 
the same entities/persons that controlled the previous Guarantor.

2. the Successor Guarantor's Credit Rating could not be lower than the lesser 
of (y) A2/A or (z) the predecessor Guarantor's Credit Rating prior to the 
transfer

3. the Successor Guarantor had to have a total net worth of at least 
$200,000,000

4. the Successor Guarantor had to be the direct or indirect parent of J Aron.


Their lawyer is telling me that now that Goldman is public, it cannot agree 
to item #1.  Are you okay if the criteria is just items 2,3 and 4?

There is a certain fervency surrounding this individual who has proven to be more than a little challenging.

We are in the process of expeditiously dispatching the requested natural gas prices spurred from the Henry Hub. A comparative look at the climatological conditions influencing the pricing data of last year's winter, as well as the winter of '95/'96, could provide enlightening context.

Simultaneously, we are marshalling resources to assemble the electricity pricing details you requested for Cinergy, Cobb, and Palo Verde, albeit under certain stipulations. In compliance with intellectual property protocols, you should formally approach Financial Times, the publishers of Megawatts Daily, to solicit permission to utilize their pricing index.

This is a standard practice for us, as we must respect the proprietary laws that prohibit us from freely disseminating such information. 

Kindly make it known to them that your inquiry is solely for academic research purposes. Subject to approval from FT, we are more than ready to generate the time series correlations you need based on the data derived from Megawatts Daily.

,,,"Dear Gregory,

In the midst of our discussion on Monday, two significant details seemed to have been inadvertently omitted. 

Firstly, the compelling case of Mr. Joe Carson. There is no doubt that his commanding presence struck an impressive chord. With an ever-increasing need for seasoned economists within Enron's ranks, Mr. Carson's extensive experience and recognition within the sector could be a valuable asset to us. His pragmatic approach, coupled with a likely promising sense of steadiness, could indeed be a marriage of benefits with his expected role here.

There lies the challenge, however \u2014 Mr. Carson's preference to operate out of New York. We have to carefully weigh this geographical element against the advantage of his skilled presence in close proximity to our desks.

Secondly, it's worth considering the potential benefits Mr. Tony Mends could offer Enron. During my personal interactions with Mr. Mends, I've found him to be a remarkably intelligent and efficient individual. As a friend, my judgment may be influenced by personal relations, but I think there's little denial of his problem-solving proficiency that our organization, which deals with mammoth volumes of information processing, could greatly benefit from. Many thanks for considering these points.

,,PRC Derivatives Trading,"Heather:

Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:

Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into 
derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions (""NBFI""); and
c. foreign invested enterprises (""FIE"").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative 
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned 
enterprises (""WFOE""); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (""SFJV"") and 
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There 
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into 
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned 
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact 
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil 
Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the 
authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.

I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a 
year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd 
be happy to send a copy on.

,,Confirms Issues,"Sara:
Thanks for your voice mail message.  David Dupre and I have not done all that 
much to date.  He is in the process of compiling information for all 
counterparties (online and offline) who are not signing confirms.  I have 
asked him to group these counterparties according to total outstanding 
exposure so that we can priortize our efforts.  I think that the main issues 
to cover on Friday involve:

1. The effect of not getting signed confirms when we have our standard 
langugae in the confirm or in the ISDA and whether it makes adifference as to 
whether NY or Texas law applies.

2. Possible alternative approaches that we can suggest to counterparties.  
For example, in some cases, a counterparty is sending us a letter attaching a 
list of the deals that they have done with us and stating that they agree 
with the terms of such deals.  I'll have David D. send up a sample.

3. Whether our concerns are greater or lesser when we do trades online.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui

,,Re: Enron Default Swaps,"Dear Darrell,

Enclosed for review are two notes of a technical nature concerning Enron default swaps; I trust these writings will prove invaluable in your examination of the matter. I anticipate engaging with the associated articles over the forthcoming weekend and look forward with keen interest to discerning whether their explanations are to your satisfaction.

Apologies are in order for the sluggish pace at which we are preparing an array of technical documents for your assessment including model reviews. Irrespective of this delay, we harbor the hope that you might set aside a modicum of time for a detailed appraisal of our credit models linked with our London credit trading, as well as our Value at Risk and option pricing-related models.

In addition, may I politely request that you cross-verify your invoices? The records at my end suggest a lingering balance due from us to you.

,,Re: Gwen Koepke,"Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor 
or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal 
customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which 
were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the 
importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed 
revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next 
Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the 
outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to 
talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Mark

It bears mentioning that a digital divide may influence our data, given that households with greater affluence and higher levels of education are those most likely to be connected to the Internet. 

A posited solution to this issue presents itself in the creation of a control group. This could be achieved by requesting clerical staff from the School to participate in our questionnaire. Moreover, it might be beneficial to extend our reach by having them distribute the questionnaire to their circles of friends and family.

,,Regarding: SPSS Request for Iris,"Dear Vasant,

After due consideration, I've granted approval, albeit somewhat grudgingly, to Iris' request for an SPSS access. In reviewing the situation, it became evident that her work in London justifies the use of SPSS.

That said, a proliferation of systems is an area of concern for me.

,,Team Project #2---Problem #2,"I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I 
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet 
Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized 
her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the 
""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, 
and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The 
answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the 
report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez 
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a 
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable 
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the 
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, 
beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with 
something remotely similar.

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.

,,Comments,"Alicia
The only comment that I have to the swap schedules is that I think we need to 
have an exception built into the arbitration language that permits us to go 
to court to enforce the remedies that we describe in the confidentiality 
section.  This probably hold true for all of the docs where we have 
arbitration and a ca provision.  Alos, there may be some defined terms that 
are now used in the new confidentiality language that haven't been defined 
(i.e, Enron, Enron Put Agreement etc)  Finally, should we upper case 
""affiliates"" in the confidentiality   language and either use the ISDA def or 
some other def?

,,NYMEX Congressional Testimony,"Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?

,,Response to Comments,"Susan:
We have finally had a chance to internally discuss the comments that you sent 
to Marie Heard on March 21 by e-mail and here is our response:

ISDA Comments

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We will agree to $100,000,00 for both parties

3. It is Enron's Policy to use Loss instead of Market Quotation, which I 
believe is the standard that is currently used in the existing Master.  As a 
compromise, we can agree to Market Quotation for Transactions with a term of 
2 years or less as of the applicable termination date and Loss for all others.

4. Item #4 is fine.

5. Our credit people want to keep MAC where it is as a trigger that reduces 
the collateral threshold to zero.

6. I would like to discuss with you what we are doing with the existing 
Guarantys.

7. Item #7 is okay but we would prefer a separate termination agreement.

8. I need to discuss with you items #8 and 10   

CSA COMMENTS

1. Item #1 is fine

2. We cannot agree to item #2 and would like for it to remain at 20

3. I would like to discuss item #3 with you

Also, some of the changes that were made were not marked (i.e., no fault 
termination was not in our draft, but in yours).  Could you please e-mail me 
your latest versions so that I can make sure that I have seen all of the 
changes?  With respect to no-fault termination, we cannot as a policy matter 
agree to that.  I look forward to hearing from you.

,,KN Marketing and Onoek,"Brant
Per our discussions, here is what the Oneok folks want to do.


1. We currently have 2 Masters - one with KN Marketing LP (now known as Oneok 
Energy Marketing & Trading Company, LP) and one with Oneok Gas Marketing 
Company.  Pursuant to the Guaranty that you just received, both Masters are 
currently guaranteed by Oneok Inc.  In addition, both Masters are currently 
guaranteed by Enron Corp. under a $15,000,000 Guaranty for Onoek Gas and a 
$10, 000,000 Guaranty for KN.

2. The Oneok folks want Oneok Gas Marketing to assign all trades and its 
Master to KN Marketing LP and to terminate the KN Marketing LP Master.  When 
all is said and done, there will be one Master with KN Marketing LP and all 
trading activity will be with this entity.  As I mentioned to you, the Master 
that will remain in place has no Credit Support Annex.  How much should the 
Enron Guaranty be for?


Call me if you have any questions.

Susan,
Could you please prepare an assignment and Termination Agreement for this.  
Brant will let us know if any amendments need to be made to the Oneok Master.

because we will get these reps in another agreement from the Trust.  Is that 
correct?

2. In Section 3.4 e), the new language regarding rescission of acceleration I 
think belongs after the phrase that begins, ""if the effect of such 
failure...""  Also, where did the new language regarding prepayments at the 
end come from?  Is this in the Revolver or in Enron's existing deals?

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense 
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to 
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London 
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

There is a certain fervency surrounding this individual who has proven to be more than a little challenging.

Nevertheless, we harbor a certain degree of appreciation for the interest he's demonstrated towards Enron throughout this process.

,,Re: Enron Monterrey/Vitro,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

,,NYMEX Congressional Testimony,"Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?

Whilst I have your attention, Larry, I wish to revisit a request previously expressed, involving the Prediction Company. Our intent remains casual - simply an opportunity for an introduction and open discourse, affirmed with no explicit obligations.

It would certainly be beneficial if you could introduce me to your esteemed contact at your earliest convenience.

,,,"Dear David,

We deliberated today over the challenges concerning value-at-risk (VaR) coordination, specifically regarding the transformation of the forward pricing curves into our primary business locations. 

This transformation, otherwise known as mapping, is a necessary adjustment. It is driven by our computer system's limitations, which compel us to modify the problem's scale while staying within the confines of our available processing power. Additionally, we also confront scenarios in which the quality of price discovery is subpar, making independent modeling of price curves a formidable task. To mitigate such problems, we merge price curves into the more robust and manageable core-location curves. 

We arrived at the unanimous consensus on the following measures:

1. Winston will delve deeper into the technological side, ascertaining the scope for an increase in the number of forward price curves that can be introduced as core staples. He will gauge the impact of an elevated number of these core curves on the time necessary to execute a VaR operation completely.

2. The top 10-20 positions in each commodity that are closely affiliated with the curves should be molded as core curves. This approach would eschew the requirement for any mapping into alternative locations. Strategically monitoring significant risks separately while evading consolidation into less lucid aggregates is a logical path forward.

3. The outcomes of an automatic clustering or mapping system should be periodically examined by human analysts and rectified should they inaccurately reflect the trading position risks. This duty needs to be vested in a single person, given that current dispersion across the organization often results in lack of accountability. We have the potential to assign a dedicated individual from our research department to this task, on the precondition that both the trading and RAC teams fully cooperate.

,,Re: CHARM,"Dear Jim,

Upon preliminary inspection, CHARM appears to be in its embryonic stage, necessitating significant development efforts to transition into a full-fledged production instrument. 

We have previously conceived a model similar to CHARM - barring a few sophisticated functionalities that CHARM possesses - within a span of approximately two weeks, at the behest of our recent recruit, Rick Jones, formerly at HSB. Jones, having experience working on a comparable model at his former organization, wished to utilize a like tool for his ensuing projects here at Enron. Further details regarding this would be more suitably discussed at our forthcoming face-to-face rendezvous, which with some luck, will transpire by the end of this week. 

I would advise Willis to consider the fact that the model may require additional refinement before Enron can evaluate it for commercial utilization.

before we can talk so probably nothing will happen until Wednesday morning 
when I see him.  All I can do know is take it easy and try not to think about 
what might happen.  There's not much I can do and the only way that I will 
know that there is a problem is if I start bleeding.  The baby is fine.  He's 
almost 3 pounds and Arthur got to see him today which was great!  Needless to 
say, no more running nad unfortunately for Bill no more sex!  The one funny 
thing that happened was when the doctor was trying to tell us that we could 
not have sex and she didn't want to use the word sex because Arthur was there 
so she used the word ""relations"".  Bill couldn't understand  what she was 
saying and I know you had to be there but I just cracked up.  I also had a 
good laugh when the doctor found out that I was a runner.  She looked me 
right in the eye and said ""no more running"" which is what I expected.  Again, 
you had to be there!

Anyway, barring no further problems, I'll be in tomorrow and we'll just take

2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in 
our Schedule

3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it 
a Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a 
Baa3 rating by Moody's.

4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a 
requirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we 
make available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank 
regulatory authorities

5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option 
transactions.

6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation 
of an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event 
Upon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to ""matured and unmatured"" 
obligations.

7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty

8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that 
have an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method 
works.  I'm still trying to understand what this language does but it appears 
to qualify any payments on termination that the Non-Defaulting Party would 
have to make to the Defaulting Party.

I will send you a copy of their comments and hopefully we will talk to them 
about this next week.

,,Re: Interview,"Steve,

I submitted my evaluation. General impression was rather
negative: he seems to be a consultant type person
who speaks about everything with confidence  but is short on depth
and technical details.

He is personable, outspoken, organized - on the positive
side.

Also, the red flag is that he jumps from job to job: typical after
18-24 months when any organization can ascertain his usefulness.

,,night before christmas,"'Twas The Night Before Christmas
as written by a lawyer

'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual 
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity 
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.""

,,Re: Regarding Tony Hamilton,"Dear Chris,

We initially hired Mr. Hamilton as a reinforcement for our Global Markets department. However, considering the highly specialized character of his work, Mr. Jeff Shankman has made the apt decision to station Mr. Hamilton within the Research Group, with a clear line of communication established with Mr. Mike Roberts, the current leader of our weather group.

In light of Mr. Hamilton's work, which is predicted to cater exclusively and directly to our Global Markets endeavor, it seems most logical for his expenses to be charged to Global Markets. We will carry out necessary adjustments to ensure his contributions will be represented to their fullest across various sub-units within Global Markets.

Mr. Hamilton has been dedicating the recent weeks to his training in Houston, in preparation for his forthcoming role in London alongside Mr. Roberts. We are brimming with anticipation for the prospects this cooperative endeavor presents.

,,Re: Mission Successful,"Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch 
at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my 
house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year 
old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was 
voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and 
Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed 
for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  
Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But 
she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought 
her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life. 

I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal 
Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night

Here is our response to your e-mail comments:

1. We can put back VI(c)(i) but the reason that we deleted it was because the 
provisions in VI(c)(ii) and VI(E) really deal with how an LC can be drawn 
upon and the language in VI(c)(i) seemed unnecessary and perhaps inconsistent 
with those sections.  If we put it back in, it should be made subject to 
those other sections.

2. With respect to your points regarding the amount that can be drawn, I am 
unclear as to what your position is.  In one place you want to limit it to 
amounts owed and in another you want to limit it to Exposure Amount.  What is 
your position.  We thought that the formula that we set forth in Section 4(b) 
of the amendment was what everyone had agreed to.

3. The reason for the change in E.4.(c) is because the Event of Default 
situation has already been addressed in VI(c)(ii).

4. I need to check with our credit people regarding the transferability 
issue.  I will note that the current form that is attached to the Master

,,Discrepancies in the Contract Document,"Dear Sheila,

I hope this message finds you well. I write to highlight a slight deviation spotted between the provisional draft and the fully ratified version of the contract. Unfortunately, I inadvertently overlooked bringing the draft along for today's proceedings.

My apologies for the inconvenience, but to rectify this situation, I will ensure that a copy of the draft is on your desk tomorrow for review.

Moreover, it has been noticed that the final copy does not fully incorporate all hand-written modifications made by Greg in the preliminary draft. I felt it essential to ensure you're cognizant of these discrepancies.

Mark and I were reviewing the Eligible Swap Participant rules and the

If our counterparty is a limited partnership but our credit group is relying 
on the credit of the GP, do the rules require a written guaranty from the GP 
or is it enough to rely on the fact that under law the GP is jointly and 
severally liable for the LP's obligations?  One of our counterparties is a 
limited partnership whose GP is a utility and their counsel has advised us 
that for regulatory reasons, the GP cannot enter into a Guaranty.  I look 
forward to hearing from you.

,,SG Interests V,"Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

Reference is made to the Guaranty Agreement dated as of September 1, 1998 
from American Central Gas Companies, Inc. (""Guarantor"") for the benefit of 
Enron North America Corp. (""Enron"").  By letter addressed to you dated April 
6, 2000 (the ""Termination Letter""), Guarantor terminated its obligations 
under the Guaranty.  The purpose of this letter is to notify Enron that such 
Termination Letter is null and void such that no termination of the Guaranty 
by Guarantor has occurred.  In addition, Guarantor hereby agrees to amend the 
Guaranty by (1) changing the amount set forth in Section 1(b) from $1,000,000 
to $2,000,000 and (2) by changing the text of the fourth paragraph in Section 
6 to read as follows:  ""This Guaranty shall terminate on the date (such date 
being the ""Termination Date"") that is the earlier of (a) July __, 2000 or (b) 
the effective date of any written notice of termination sent by Guarantor as 
set forth below.   Guarantor may terminate this Guaranty by providing written 
notice of such termination to ECT and upon the effectiveness of such 
termination, Guarantor shall have no further liability hereunder, except as 
provided in the last sentence of this paragraph.  No such termination by 
Guarantor shall be effective until five (5) days after receipt by ECT of such 
termination notice.  No termination of this Guaranty pursuant to the 
provisions of this paragraph shall affect Guarantor's liability with respect 
to any Transaction (as defined in the Contracts) entered into prior to the 
Termination Date, which Transaction shall remain guaranteed pursuant to the 
terms of this Guaranty.""

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be

old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was 
voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and 
Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed 
for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  
Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But 
she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought 
her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life. 

I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal 
Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night 
and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night 
out at a blues club.

This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting 
with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All 
my love,

,,PRC Derivatives Trading,"Heather:

Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:

Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into 
derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions (""NBFI""); and
c. foreign invested enterprises (""FIE"").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative 
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned 
enterprises (""WFOE""); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (""SFJV"") and 
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There 
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into 
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned 
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact 
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil 
Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the 
authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.

I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a 
year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd 
be happy to send a copy on.

Per your request, here is what we have decided:

1. Our 2 best candidates were Jackie McCoy and Samantha Boyd.  As I mentioned 
to you, Mark will be talking to HR about making an offer to Samantha Boyd but 
until she formally accepts, we don't want to lose Jackie or say anything to 
her.

2. We have passed on the following candidates:

Stephanie Panus
Patricia Slaughter
Donald Duhon
Debra Vincent


Of this group, we may pass on to other groups that have expressed interest  
to Mark Taylor in hiring for a non-legal position, the resumes of Stephanie 
Panus and Debra Vincent and certainly Jackie McKoy if Samantha accepts.  It 
would be helpful to know from you when these particular  passed over 
candidates have been notified so that we don't cause confusion if we send 
their resume elsewhere.

Also, do you have references for Samantha?

Just to touch base on a few salient points.

Please accept my apologies as certain administrative tasks have currently found my presentation development lagging. I take responsibility for this delay.

Notwithstanding, I assure you that the requisite number of presentation copies will be ready by the day of the event, or potentially a day in advance. Drawing from prior experience, I arranged similar protocol during Power 2000 and Power 1999. Please note that our company's Copy Center produced these copies, causing no added expense to your end.

On a related note, my accomplished colleague, Tanya Tamarchenko, has been invaluable in aiding with a particular aspect of the presentation. Considering her tremendous contribution, it would be fitting for her to present part of the speech. It is of utmost importance to me that credit is appropriately given where it's due. To acknowledge her work, might I propose including her as an additional speaker?

Rod:
I found my file and here is where things stand:

1. On cross default threshold, they wanted it to be the same as the 
collateral threshold but my notes indicate that they were okay leaving it at 
$100,000.

2. In lieu of receiving financials from them, we had agreed to accept 
quarterly and annual Lease Operating Statements.  Did I use the correct 
term?  Do we need a definition for this or is it understood what these 
statements are?  I am also assuming that they are internally prepared.  Is 
that correct?  My notes indicate that these would be provided within 90 days 
after quarter end.

3. We agreed to a collateral threshold for them of $500,000.

4.  For the MAC trigger, is the only test the Net Cash Flow/Revenue test and 
if so, what would trigger the MAC?  Are there other triggers?  We used to 
have Funded Debt/Partners Capital, EBITDA Coverage Ratio and Minimum Partners 
Capital tests.  Alos, here are my proposed definitions:

Cash Flow means Net Income plus depreciation and non-cash charges minus 
capital expenditures as shown on the income statement.

Net Income means gross revenues and other proper income credits, less all 
proper income charges, including taxes on income.

Revenue is cash received from the sale of oil, gas and plant products. 

Should there be references to the Lease Operating Statements in these 
definitions?

5. All Performance Assurance would be rounded up to multiples of $10,000.

This is all that I have.  Let me know what you think.

We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died

I thought was pretty awesome!? My favorite was his Harry Truman quote that I 
had never heard before:? ""If you want to live like a Republican, you better 
vote like a Democrat.""? Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use!

Joke: 
Memory Clinic 
Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
one of the men asked the other, ""Fred, how was the memory 
clinic you went to last month?"" 

""Outstanding,"" Fred replied. ""They taught us all the latest 
psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
It was great."" 

""That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?"" 

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
""What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
thorns?"" 

""You mean a rose?"" 

""Yes, that's it!"" 

He turned to his wife, ""Rose, what was the name of that 
memory clinic?""

ECC and Pancanadian Petroleum Limited and Pancanadian wants to pretty much 
duplicate this Master.  Here are the credit terms of the late 1998 drfat that 
we sent them which I need for you to tell me are still okay:


No Credit Support Providers
Cross Default - $50,000,000 for ENA and $25,000,000 for them
Additional Event of Default - occurrence of a MAC and the failure to provide 
Perfprmance Assurance in accordnace with annex A.  MAC is defined as 
 Enron's rating going below BBB- and their Net Worth falling below 
$133,000,000 opr their Funded Debt to Net Worth being more than 1 to 1
They want to defined the ""control"" concept in Affiliate as ownership of more 
than 50% of equity.  This term is used in the Setoff language and limits the 
possible  entities that could be Affiliates on our side and their side
Forms of collateral are cash and LC's
Collateral Thresholds are $10,000,000 for us and $3,500,000 for them

Joke: 
Memory Clinic 
Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
one of the men asked the other, ""Fred, how was the memory 
clinic you went to last month?"" 

""Outstanding,"" Fred replied. ""They taught us all the latest 
psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
It was great."" 

""That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?"" 

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
""What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
thorns?"" 

""You mean a rose?"" 

""Yes, that's it!"" 

He turned to his wife, ""Rose, what was the name of that 
memory clinic?""

old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was

as AA has not yet approved.  The deal basically involves creating a new 
entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and 
associated contracts which ECT currently owns.  The compressor motor drivers 
are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority 
(NTUA).  ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in 
exchange for $$ and MMBtus.  

Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.  This is a 
2nd Quarter deal.  Would you expect anything less?  Please let me know who 
will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions.  
Thanks.

Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave

treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals

the trade, we're not surprised.

,,Petro Canada,"John:
I was reviewing an amendment that Susan bailey was working on concerning the 
ISDA Master between ECC and Petro Canada and wanted to make sure that you 
were comfortable leaving as is the following provisions that are in the 
Schedules:

1. They have amended the definition of Specified Indebtedness.  I'm not sure 
I understand  why if we have a threshold amount they need the first part of 
the language and wanted your thoughts on this.  Alos, does the second part of 
the language need to be updated or revised in any manner?

2. They have deleted the concept of Credit event Upon Merger.

3. They have added to Specified Transaction a Physical Master Agreement which 
makes this part of the cross default to specified transaction Event of 
Default trigger.  Should we specify a threshold?

4. They have added an additional termination event that contains some unusual 
ratings triggers.  For example, are we rated by the 2 bond rating services 
that they describe, and if not, doesn't that trigger clause (2) of this 
additional Termination Event?   I don;'t think the cure language works and I 
don't understand how it works with the collateral threshold since the trigger 
for that to go to zero is something else.

5. I'll just note that setoff rights do not currently apply if there is a 
Termination Event that is caused by Tax Event or Tax Event Upon Merger.

6. In the CSA, we have permitted cash and government securities which I think 
is problematic given our general rule in Canada that we only take LC's.

7. There is a Minimum Transfer Amount of $500,000.

Please call me when convenient to discuss further.

,,PSE&G,"Tanya:
I just received a revised draft of the ISDA Schedule.  There is just 1 point 
that I want to raise with you.  You may recall that in Credit Event Upon 
Merger we created a special exception for them in connection with their 
upcoming reorg which stated that either the transferee or its Credit Support 
Provider would have to have a Credit Rating of BBB- or better OR Baa3 or 
better.  They now have added this same concept as a carve-out/exception to 
the ""transfer"" provisions in section 7, such that upon any transfer, the 
other party cannot withhold its consent to such transfer if the transferee 
provides a Guaranty from an entity that meets the above ratings test.  Are 
you okay with this as a general carve out for all types of transfers?  Our 
typical language is that we can withhold our consent unless the transferee 
provides a satisfactory guaranty to us.

,,Comments to Latest Drafts,"Adele:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the ISDA and CSA Schedules that 
you sent to me:

1. In Part 1, Section (e) of the ISDA Schedule, right after the definition of 
PSE&G Reorganization Transaction you need to delete ""S&P"".  I also need to 
see what you are planning to put on Annex C.

2. I am checking with my credit person regarding the language that you added 
to Part 5, Section (h) - Transfer.

3. In the CSA, I thought that both threshold amounts were to be at 
$7,500,000.  In addition, in the proviso after threshold, the term ""Specified 
Condition"" should be changed to ""Material Adverse Change"".  A Mac would be 
triggered if Credit Ratings were below BBB-.

4. In Paragraph 13, Section (e), if the only types of collateral are cash or 
LC's why is consent required to substitute?

5. I would like to discuss with you our proposed Insert 4 to Paragraph 13, 
Section (h)(iii).

6. In Paragraph 13, Section (j)(ii)(2), why was the last sentence deleted?

7. I need to discuss with you just a few issues on the LC provisions.  I will 
send you a mark-up with my thoughts and questions.

Hopefully we can get this resolved next week.  Tuesday through Thursday of 
next week work best for me. I will fax to you a mark-up with my nits and

,,PRC Derivatives Trading,"Heather:

Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:

Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into 
derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions (""NBFI""); and
c. foreign invested enterprises (""FIE"").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative 
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned 
enterprises (""WFOE""); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures (""SFJV"") and 
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There 
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into 
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned 
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact 
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil

,,Joe Carson,"Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies
    on processing huge volumes of information.

,,ECT NYMEX Hedge Exemption Applications,"To:  ECT Officers and Employees
From:  Mark Taylor, Vice President and Assistant General Counsel, ECT Legal

We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ECT's NYMEX energy commodity futures trading.  These applications require 
that ECT represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a 
power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other related 
commodity future account(s) either individually or acting with another person 
pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please let me know by the end of business May 31, 1999 if you have any power 
of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures 
account (other than an ECT account).

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call me at (713)

I have duly completed and submitted my assessment. Despite some redeeming qualities, my overall evaluation of the candidate leans toward the negative.

The candidate demonstrated a demeanor more akin to that of a consultant, proffering confident statements devoid of operational depth or the intricacies of technical detail. His traits include affable interpersonal skills, outspokenness, and organizational capabilities, which certainly earn him points on the positive side.

However, an area of concern is his seemingly unsettled professional history, characterized by frequent transitions between jobs, typically within an 18 to 24 month period. This pattern suggests an inability to sustain long-term commitments or to leave lasting impacts in organizations that can truly measure his efficacy.

,,Team Project #2---Problem #2,"I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I 
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet 
Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized 
her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the 
""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, 
and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The 
answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the 
report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez 
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a 
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable 
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the 
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, 
beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with 
something remotely similar.

Why I don't think that we need to say anything with respect to the July 29th

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be

certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it 
may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial 
power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the 
question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as

,,Comments to Swap Docs,"Alicia and Trina:
Here are my thoughts on the latest drafts of the swap docs:

Put Confirm

1. Looks like some type of price protection mechanism is contemplated in the 
Master Derivatives Agreement and I'm assuming it would go into this confirm
2. In the definitions of ISDA and Equity Definitions, please add amendments 
and supplements

Harrier/Talon Schedule

1. We need to discuss footnotes 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 13
2. I think that the mechanics for putting up the LC that is described in the 
Additional Termination Event that was added as clause (iv) needs to be 
drafted somewhere to address, for example, drawing conditions, what happens 
when Enron's credit rating improves, the comment made in footnote 6 etc.

3. In Part 4, Section (a) and in all of the notice sections the notice that 
goes to the AGC of the Trading Group goes to Enron North America Corp. not 
Enron Corp. 
4. In Part 5, Section (l)(Recording) please add after the word ""parties"" the 
phrase ""in connection with the Transactions hereunder.""
5. In Part 5, Section (o) (Confidentiality), is the class of permitted 
discloses in clause (iv) too broad?


Talon/Enron Schedule

1. In Part 1, Section (h) should a carve out from the definition of 
Identified Event be the new Termination Event that was added?
2. Why is Part 5, Section (n) in this Schedule?
3. Same comments as above

Master Derivatives Agreement

1. Is the defined term Net Premiums worded right for purposes of the 
$400,000,000 limitation?  For some reason, I'm thinking that a and b should 
be reversed.

Talon Note

1. In Section 3.2, I'm not sure that the reference in the second paragraph to 
Part 5(m)(i) of the Enron Schedule applies since the setoff rights only 
benefit Enron and its affiliates.  Also,  what does it mean to refer to the 
Enron Guaranty here?

Enron Guaranty

1. In Section 4, I think that it is fair for them to request that setoff only 
apply to the Guaranteed Agreements and unless I'm missing something, I think 
we can give on that point.

That's all that I have.  Have you discussed with Ben the point that we talked 
about last week concerning the difference between the calculation of ""Net 
Talon Loss"" versus ""Loss""?


I'm available tomorrow to talk about these points.

Despite this, it's important we don't cast aside the intelligence he has presented. His inputs appear to carry a weight of significance which I believe would be unwise to ignore or fail to address.

,,Team Project #2---Problem #2,"I think Dennis, Shawne and I were supposed to work more on #2, but since I 
can't recall, I'm sending to all.

First, I apologize.  I tried to work directly with the excellent spreadsheet 
Carolyn put together, but I kept fumbling, butchering, etc.  So I canibalized 
her great stuff and created a new spreadsheet, attempting to incorporate the 
""clarifications"" (yeah, right) that Prof McCullough distributed via email, 
and the stuff we talked about during break (i.e., timing of cash flows).  The 
answers are at the bottom of the work sheet.  And I've also included the 
report (though I did not peruse it for errors, relevancy, etc.).  

My  biggest concern is question 6.  My answer (despite some outliers) sez 
that there ain't no loan in June.  (This may mean my spreadsheet's got a 
fatal flaw--significant probability.)

Finally, doing a series of 1,000 trials resulted in some considerable 
variability across runs--again, could be due to screw up on my part--so the 
answers I generatd comes from a run of 5,000 trials.  (If you run the sheet, 
beware, 5,000 takes some time, unless you've got DSL or something.)

Let me know if this is completely out to lunch, or if you're coming up with 
something remotely similar.

Best,
Jeff

something to help my brain.

,,Golfing with Jesus,"Moses, Jesus and an old man are golfing. Moses steps up to the tee
and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a
water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto
the green.

Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over
the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the
water and chips the ball onto the green.

The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing
over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it 
falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth.
As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down 
and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where 
a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, 
the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball 
pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.

Jesus turns to the old man and says, ""Dad, if you don't stop fooling
around, we won't bring you next time.""

Upon preliminary inspection, CHARM appears to be in its embryonic stage, necessitating significant development efforts to transition into a full-fledged production instrument. 

We have previously conceived a model similar to CHARM - barring a few sophisticated functionalities that CHARM possesses - within a span of approximately two weeks, at the behest of our recent recruit, Rick Jones, formerly at HSB. Jones, having experience working on a comparable model at his former organization, wished to utilize a like tool for his ensuing projects here at Enron. Further details regarding this would be more suitably discussed at our forthcoming face-to-face rendezvous, which with some luck, will transpire by the end of this week. 

I would advise Willis to consider the fact that the model may require additional refinement before Enron can evaluate it for commercial utilization.

,,RE: Letter agreement,"Here's the latest from GE.

When I spoke to Rob Stevens, he had a question about whether Mitsui needed to 
review the final drafts of the GE agreements. I don't know the resolution of 
that issue.

As you know, the current arrangement with GE requires payment within 3 days 
of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the 
contract, then wire the money from EEIM to Mitsui immediately so that Mitsui 
can pay GE, and GE can refund ENA.  Has EEIM been funded yet and has Mitsui 
bought in on the payment plan?

I do not know the status of the tax issues raised by Jeff. I would also like 
to make sure that Jeff agrees with the mechanism of superseding the prior 
agreement with GE.

new Omnibus Counterparties.

2. Last week, Mary provided us with a list of new Omnibus Counterparties for

are in the process of faxing the Annex A letter which gives them until the 
end of April to respond.  With respect to the Canadian counterparties we are 
waiting to hear back from Derek before we send them the letter.

3. We need to receive from Mary a list of any additional new Omnibus 
Counterparties, if any, that have done trades with us since the date of the 
list that she gave us last week so that we can include them in the mail-out.  
It is my understanding that Mary will leave Marie Heard a voice mail about 
this today so that we can make arrangements for the letters to be sent to 
those counterparties.  Hopefully, that group will be small.

4. The plan is to roll out the new Annex A's to everyone beginning on May 1.

,,Additions to Special Handling List,"Joe, Jeff an Bob:
Here is a summary of those counterparties that have had specific objections 
to our new form of Annex A:

1. Sithe Energy - wants New York law to apply

2. Voest-Alpine Intertrading USA, Inc. - won't agree to the setoff 
language.   Credit should be consulted prior to any further trades to see if 
they are okay with this given our relationships with this entity.

3. Madison Gas & Electric - will not agree to the ""or otherwise"" language in 
the setoff language.  Again, this is a credit issue.

4. Cargill - wouldn't review the new language because we are close to getting 
a master in place with them.  Sara expects this to happen in the next few 
days.

5. Idacorp Energy Solutions, L.P. -  same as Cargill.  I am working on this 
one and their attorney owes me a response.  This one may take a few weeks.

6. Formosa Plastics - this is the counterparty that sent the threatening 
letter.  It didn't appear from our records that we have traded financial 
derivatives with them recently.

7. General Electric Company - won't accept the chnages and have failed to 
tell me specifically what they object to.  I will continue to follow up with 
their attorney.

8. Basin Exploration, Inc. - same as General Electric.

9. TransMontaigne Product services Inc. - sent letter out on March 30 saying 
they would respond in 30 days and I have never heard back from them.  I will 
follow up with their attorney.

10. Reliant - they didn't accept the new language that we added as clause (z) 
to Section 3(e) and wanted to deal with this differently in the confirmation 
as a trigger that would give us the right to call for collateral.  Credit 
should be alerted.

11. Devon Energy - they had in the past requested more time to review Annex A 
and when I followed up with them last week, they still didn't have a response.

12. Smurfit - Stone Container - same as Devon energy.

13. Public Service Gas & Electric Company - we are close to finalizing an 
ISDA with them.  If we do any trades with them before one is signed they have 
requested chnages in few areas to match what we have agreed to in the iSDA 
negotiations.  I can prepare a mark-up.

second sentence where we say that they cannot utilize the Website on behalf 
of third parties they want to exclude Affiliates.  [Leslie, is this a proper

In light of Mr. Hamilton's work, which is predicted to cater exclusively and directly to our Global Markets endeavor, it seems most logical for his expenses to be charged to Global Markets. We will carry out necessary adjustments to ensure his contributions will be represented to their fullest across various sub-units within Global Markets.

Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or 
laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.  
Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in 
effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you

,,,"Dear Anne,

Thank you for reaching out to discuss the ongoing situation regarding Gwen Koepke. Indeed, this is a matter that has been awaiting resolution for some time and it's just as well that I wanted to bring this to our discussion today.

Our inclination should be to upgrade Gwen to the managerial status, a change which could potentially come into effect from March 1. In doing so, her remuneration will reflect her elevated status, including her current base salary with an additional $10,000, a practice that aligns with our typical protocol when promoting an associate to a managerial position. We routinely undertake such promotions in the month of March, and Gwen should not bear the consequences for any lack of efficiency in our management, manifest in the prolonged delays by Maureen and myself.

Separating from this issue, an unrelated yet grave matter requires our attention. Gary Hickerson, who is the primary recipient of Maureen's services, expressed dissatisfaction with her contributions a few weeks ago. Regrettably, he's reluctant to continue funding Maureen's position. This implies that Maureen must either secure another sponsor within Enron or seek employment elsewhere. Given her assertive and occasionally confrontational demeanor, finding an internal sponsor may well prove difficult. In an act of generosity, Gary has offered to finance a considerably substantial severance package for Maureen from his own budget. I'd be interested to discuss this with you further when time allows.

Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo

,,VaR,"David,

During today's VaR coordination meeting  we had a discussion of issues 
related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations.

Mapping is a  necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system:
we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds
of available CPU memory. Also, in some cases the quality of price discovery 
is poor 
and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the 
problem by mapping
them into more liquid and better behaved core  locations curves.

We have agreed on the following:

1. Winston will investigate the IT side and determine to what extent we can 
increase the number
of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. He will 
investigate the impact of a larger
number of the core curves on the time required to complete the VaR run.

2. The curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity 
should be
modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). It makes sense 
to monitor
the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into  less 
transparent aggregates.

3. The results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be 
systematically
monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the 
trading positions.
This responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the 
responsibility is
dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody
is responsible). Research can allocate one person to this task;
cooperation of trading and RAC will be critical.

,,Bit of Background on Global Photon Opportunity,"Greetings:

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time, 
we'll try to conduct some preliminary due diligence via email, voicemail, 
etc.  I've asked GP to get us their audited financial statements for purposes 
of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless"" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Subject: Bill's speech - and a very funny joke




I thought was pretty awesome!? My favorite was his Harry Truman quote that I 
had never heard before:? ""If you want to live like a Republican, you better 
vote like a Democrat.""? Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use!

Joke: 
Memory Clinic 
Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
one of the men asked the other, ""Fred, how was the memory 
clinic you went to last month?"" 

""Outstanding,"" Fred replied. ""They taught us all the latest 
psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
It was great."" 

""That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?"" 

Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
""What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
thorns?"" 

""You mean a rose?"" 

""Yes, that's it!"" 

He turned to his wife, ""Rose, what was the name of that 
memory clinic?""

Subject: Environmental Strategy Meeting

The Environmental Strategies group invites you to attend a company-wide, 
Enron Environmental Strategy Meeting on September 15th from 9-2 (including 
lunch & snacks).  The purpose of the meeting is to start an internal dialogue

demands, which present both wholesale and retail opportunities.

description of what you do, and any suggestions to the below tentative agenda 
by Friday, September 8th.   I'll circulate these descriptions to those who 
have RSVPd along with a finalized agenda.   The location is TBD.  

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 3-9916.

,,Bankruptcy Code revisions,"Cynthia:

As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent 
Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which 
were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the 
importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed 
revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next 
Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the 
outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to 
talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Mark

,,night before christmas,"'Twas The Night Before Christmas
as written by a lawyer

'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual 
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity 
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.""

As currently written with my changes, we will return any written confidential 
information.  In addition, to the extent that we prepare internal analyses, 
memos etc.  that contain confidential information, we usually do not want to 
give our work product to the other party.  Therefore, we agree to keep it 
subject to the terms of the CA or destroy it and that is what my Insert A 
says and that is why I deleted their language.

With respect to the term Representative, that should be defined to mean any 
director, officer, employee, counsel, representative and affiliate of any 
party as well as any affiliate's directors, officers, employees, counsel or 
representative.

Have you reviewed the description of Confidential Information, and in 
particular, clause (d) and are you comfortable with it.  Other than the 
reference to the Website, is there anything else that we should add as a 
description of what we are showing them?

Finally,  per Louise's e-mail, she doesn't want to agree to the no 
solicitation language until we contract with them.  Could you please 
communicate that to them?

2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their 
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own 
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I 
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided

,,,"Dear David,

We deliberated today over the challenges concerning value-at-risk (VaR) coordination, specifically regarding the transformation of the forward pricing curves into our primary business locations. 

This transformation, otherwise known as mapping, is a necessary adjustment. It is driven by our computer system's limitations, which compel us to modify the problem's scale while staying within the confines of our available processing power. Additionally, we also confront scenarios in which the quality of price discovery is subpar, making independent modeling of price curves a formidable task. To mitigate such problems, we merge price curves into the more robust and manageable core-location curves. 

We arrived at the unanimous consensus on the following measures:

1. Winston will delve deeper into the technological side, ascertaining the scope for an increase in the number of forward price curves that can be introduced as core staples. He will gauge the impact of an elevated number of these core curves on the time necessary to execute a VaR operation completely.

2. The top 10-20 positions in each commodity that are closely affiliated with the curves should be molded as core curves. This approach would eschew the requirement for any mapping into alternative locations. Strategically monitoring significant risks separately while evading consolidation into less lucid aggregates is a logical path forward.

3. The outcomes of an automatic clustering or mapping system should be periodically examined by human analysts and rectified should they inaccurately reflect the trading position risks. This duty needs to be vested in a single person, given that current dispersion across the organization often results in lack of accountability. We have the potential to assign a dedicated individual from our research department to this task, on the precondition that both the trading and RAC teams fully cooperate.

,,Re: FW: GMM - 30 Mar 2001,"Dear Jeff,

Taking note of the diverse audience within Enron for whom our newsletter is composed, its content isn't aimed at appealing to a niche group exclusively. The offerings we provide, such as forward interest rate foreign exchange curves, are made available to an array of units throughout Enron in an effort to reevaluate our valued assets.

Indeed, both Maureen and Gwen find themselves immersed in a sea of inquiries pertaining to various global markets including, but not limited to, Argentina, Korea, and Brazil among others. It's with a keen sense of direction, we propose the newsletter to function as a comprehensive reference guide aiding in addressing these manifold queries.

,,Nacogdoches Letter,"Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know 
if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this 
issue:

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.

,,Idacorp,"Rod and Brant:
I finally received their revised draft of the Schedules.  They are still 
insisting on an Additional Termination Event that gets triggered if there is 
a MAC.  As defined, MAC means a rating that is below BBB- OR Baa3 or failure 
to have a rating from either S&P OR Moody's.  I need your guidance on this.  
MAC as defined in the CSA  which triggers the threshold going to zero works 
the same way.  I seem to recall that from a credit standpoint, we were okay 
with a MAC that would be triggered if either rating fell.  Is that correct?

Due to scheduling conflicts and in the attempt not to waste anyone's time,

of credit check.  Here is some additional information about the project.  If 
any questions come to mind based on this info, please let me know and we can 
forward along to GP for answers.  At this point we have tentatively scheduled 
a meeting with GP's CEO in the S.F. office for Tuesday, June 27th at 10 AM 
(PDT).

A Little Background:
Plan to construct an undersea fiber optic (24 fiber) cable linking several of 
California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless"" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

,,Re: ISDA Master -ECTRIC- Morgan Stanley,"Paul:

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be 
covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.  It's 
certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it 
may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial 
power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the 
question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as 
the power pool is restructured:  to the extent we have any influence over the 
resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard 
financial trading structure.

Just random thoughts.

,,Re: Interview Assessment,"Dear Steve,

I have duly completed and submitted my assessment. Despite some redeeming qualities, my overall evaluation of the candidate leans toward the negative.

The candidate demonstrated a demeanor more akin to that of a consultant, proffering confident statements devoid of operational depth or the intricacies of technical detail. His traits include affable interpersonal skills, outspokenness, and organizational capabilities, which certainly earn him points on the positive side.

However, an area of concern is his seemingly unsettled professional history, characterized by frequent transitions between jobs, typically within an 18 to 24 month period. This pattern suggests an inability to sustain long-term commitments or to leave lasting impacts in organizations that can truly measure his efficacy.

we remove the MAC trigger from the collateral threshold definition.  I have 
included some proposed language.  Also, with respect to the partnership

traditionally review LP agreements as a part of our due diligence.  Is that

,,night before christmas,"'Twas The Night Before Christmas
as written by a lawyer

'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual 
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity 
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  ""Now Dasher, now Dancer..."" et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

""Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn.""

,,Prof. Carmona's Proposal,"Dear Yannis,

After carefully examining the syllabus proposed for the upcoming course, I discovered that the majority of the subjects outlined within are part and parcel of our daily professions. Consequently, it is uncertain whether engaging Research's financial resources to facilitate this program would be the most judicious decision.

Suppose we intend to foster a collaborative relationship. In that case, it could be more efficacious to extend an invitation to Professor Carmona to contribute to one of our ongoing research initiatives.

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.

,,Re: EPRM 2001 Houston,"Dear Layla,

Just to touch base on a few salient points.

I am delighted to confirm that I'll be present at the reception with bells on.

Please accept my apologies as certain administrative tasks have currently found my presentation development lagging. I take responsibility for this delay.

Notwithstanding, I assure you that the requisite number of presentation copies will be ready by the day of the event, or potentially a day in advance. Drawing from prior experience, I arranged similar protocol during Power 2000 and Power 1999. Please note that our company's Copy Center produced these copies, causing no added expense to your end.

On a related note, my accomplished colleague, Tanya Tamarchenko, has been invaluable in aiding with a particular aspect of the presentation. Considering her tremendous contribution, it would be fitting for her to present part of the speech. It is of utmost importance to me that credit is appropriately given where it's due. To acknowledge her work, might I propose including her as an additional speaker?

Kind regards,

VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 
11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at 
the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the 
capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the 
capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and 
he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're 
it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the

,,Re: Address,"Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad 
at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and 
Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.  
We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died 
of liver cancer.  

I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it 
was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.

,,,"Dear Gregory,

In the midst of our discussion on Monday, two significant details seemed to have been inadvertently omitted. 

Firstly, the compelling case of Mr. Joe Carson. There is no doubt that his commanding presence struck an impressive chord. With an ever-increasing need for seasoned economists within Enron's ranks, Mr. Carson's extensive experience and recognition within the sector could be a valuable asset to us. His pragmatic approach, coupled with a likely promising sense of steadiness, could indeed be a marriage of benefits with his expected role here.

There lies the challenge, however \u2014 Mr. Carson's preference to operate out of New York. We have to carefully weigh this geographical element against the advantage of his skilled presence in close proximity to our desks.

Secondly, it's worth considering the potential benefits Mr. Tony Mends could offer Enron. During my personal interactions with Mr. Mends, I've found him to be a remarkably intelligent and efficient individual. As a friend, my judgment may be influenced by personal relations, but I think there's little denial of his problem-solving proficiency that our organization, which deals with mammoth volumes of information processing, could greatly benefit from. Many thanks for considering these points.

California's major coastal cities (San Diego, L.A., Santa Barbara, San Luis 
Obispo, Monterey, S.F.). Will use a ""festooned"" arrangement (i.e., exit sea 
at each city point).  Total undersea length is ~900 km.
At each coastal city, they'll have a POP to connect to PSTN.
At San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Manhattan Beach, they will deploy two, 
separate diverse cable routes from sea to POP.
Will deploy DWDM.
Plan includes eventual connections to existing and planned trans-Pacific 
systems.
In addition to ""loops"" created in SLO, SB and Manhattan Beach, plan includes 
a terrestial leg from S.F. to Monterey to create a land/sea loop between SF 
and Monterey.
Total terrestial piece is ~400 km (which includes S.F. to Monterey terrestial 
leg).
Eventually, they'd like to secure terrestial leg from Monterey to San Diego 
to create a complete loop.
Has received environmental permit from State Lands Commission; CLEC 
certification from California PUC; and is awaiting environmental permit from 
Coastal Commission.
Expect to have southern portion of system (San Diego to San Luis Obispo) 
built and lit by end of Q1 2001.  
Northern piece likely to take longer due to complications associated with 
federal wildlife preserve off of Monterey.  May end up bypassing Monterey 
altogether.
The people behind the build are techno-philes; they admit to being ""clueless"" 
when it comes to marketing the capacity.
Due to Tyco's perceived lack of performance, Tyco is out and Alcatel is in 
(per Ethan's emails).
They are distressed.  Deutschbank has $8MM in the deal and is pushing on them.
Willing to part with dark fiber for a deep discount.

Jeff

In a time where efficiency is imperative, the fresh advances in optimization theory and numerical methods can become potent tools in the hands of individuals like Mr. Percell. Such innovations pose the potential to exponentially enhance the effectiveness of our pipeline system at Enron, notably cutting down on compressor fuel usage.

,,Re: Enron Monterrey/Vitro,"Some thoughts, observations, suggestions:

1. Advantages to the single contract:

Don't need a consolidation agreement, so we don't have to negotiate one.
Better from a liability standpoint.
Easier to administer.

Is there any reason we can't go with a single contract?

2. Repayment/prepayment

I'm working with Steve on the letter agreement.

3.  Assignment to Mitsui

Steve is confirming payment issues, and ability to comply with GE's requested 
payment within 3 days of executing the contract.  This means that the 
assignment and assumption needs to be executed contemporaneously with the GE 
contract.  I have a call in to Rob Stevens to verify, in Stan's absence.  
Peggy is checking on this, also.

4. Parent guaranty.

GE is requesting an Enron parent guaranty.  From a quick review of the draft 
contract, it appears that a change in language will be necessary, since the 
current version only requires a parent guaranty in the case of an assignment 
to a certain class of assignees.  If I am correct, then I suggest consider 
inserting new language that the parent guaranty will be due 30 days after 
execution of the contract, so that Mitsui can provide the guaranty, if 
necessary.

,,Crude Oil Purchase Agreement,"Jeff:
Janice and I have been working on a deal with Fred LaGrasta that involves 
entering into a Crude Oil Purchase Agreement.  Their lawyer has come back 
with the following requests which Janice has asked me to run by you:

1. They want to delete the arbitration provision or at the very least delete 
the waiver of the right to recover attorneys fees.  They claim that this 
conflicts with an indemnity clause in the agreement for non-performance which 
allows for recovery of attorneys fees.

2. They want to delete  subsection (e) of the submission to jurisdiction 
clause which contains a waiver of the right to claim immunity from suit, 
execution, attachment or other legal process.

Can we give on these points?  They owe us back payments on financial swaps 
that we have done with them and the purpose of entering into this Purchase 
Agreement is to be able to offset what they owe us under the swaps with what 
we owe them for the crude that we purchase.  It's a long story as to how we 
ended up here but suffice it to say that this is our only hope of getting 
them to recognize the swaps and honor their obligations under the swaps so if 
there is any way taht we can accommodate their requests to get the deal done, 
that would be great.

,,,"Dear Anne,

Thank you for reaching out to discuss the ongoing situation regarding Gwen Koepke. Indeed, this is a matter that has been awaiting resolution for some time and it's just as well that I wanted to bring this to our discussion today.

Our inclination should be to upgrade Gwen to the managerial status, a change which could potentially come into effect from March 1. In doing so, her remuneration will reflect her elevated status, including her current base salary with an additional $10,000, a practice that aligns with our typical protocol when promoting an associate to a managerial position. We routinely undertake such promotions in the month of March, and Gwen should not bear the consequences for any lack of efficiency in our management, manifest in the prolonged delays by Maureen and myself.

Separating from this issue, an unrelated yet grave matter requires our attention. Gary Hickerson, who is the primary recipient of Maureen's services, expressed dissatisfaction with her contributions a few weeks ago. Regrettably, he's reluctant to continue funding Maureen's position. This implies that Maureen must either secure another sponsor within Enron or seek employment elsewhere. Given her assertive and occasionally confrontational demeanor, finding an internal sponsor may well prove difficult. In an act of generosity, Gary has offered to finance a considerably substantial severance package for Maureen from his own budget. I'd be interested to discuss this with you further when time allows.

and hits the ball. It goes sailing over the fairway and lands in a
water trap. Moses walks down, parts the water and chips the ball onto
the green.

Jesus steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing over
the fairway and lands in the water trap. Jesus just walks on the
water and chips the ball onto the green.

The old man steps up to the tee and hits the ball. It goes sailing
over the fairway and heads for the water trap. But just before it 
falls into the water, a fish jumps up and grabs the ball in its mouth.
As the fish is falling back down into the water, an eagle swoops down 
and grabs the fish in its claws.  The eagle flies over the green, where 
a lightning bolt shoots from the sky and barely misses it. Startled, 
the eagle drops the fish.  When the fish hits the ground, the ball 
pops out of its mouth and rolls into the hole for a hole-in-one.

Jesus turns to the old man and says, ""Dad, if you don't stop fooling
around, we won't bring you next time.""

,,PSE&G,"Tanya:
We finally got a draft of the CSA from their counsel.  Just a few questions 
for you:

1. Threshold amounts for both of us are $7,500,000.  For some reason, they 
gave themselves a $15,000,000 threshold.

2. I am assuming that we want a MAC trigger that will bring the threshold to 
zero.  Is the MAC trigger for both of us below BBB-?

3. For the issuer of an LC, they have that the rating can be either A- by S&P 
or A3 by Moody's.  Do you want to insist on requiring both ratings?

4. Is our Guaranty cap $15,000,000?
